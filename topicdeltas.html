            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">The digital age has made huge volumes of data readily available to investors. To generate macro-level as well as company-specific insights in a timely manner, however, has been increasingly challenging due to the information overload in the financial markets.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">If an investor were to go through all the earnings transcripts in the past 8 quarters of all the companies in the S&P 500 Index, it could take weeks to decipher the insightful information across different sectors, industries, and companies. Our goal was to create a tool that helps investors discover valuable investment opportunities from earnings transcripts in a more efficient and scalable way.</p>

                Early on, it was important to understand the technical feasibility and analytical possibilities of the data. We had a general sense that investors not only want to see all the numbers and metrics, but also the derived insights from unstructured data such as earnings transcripts. I worked with the Machine Learning Researchers to explore the data insights we were able to capture and how we could use them to help users with their problems.

                        Instead of using the sentiment itself, users were often looking for changes in sentiment from last quarter to predict stock performance. This is because the management from companies always tries to sound positive in earnings conferences.

                        We found that what was mentioned more frequently by the management team might not be considered as significant. Significant topics also depend on the trends happening around the markets, the company’s recent activities, and other factors.

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">One of the biggest challenges for analysts or investors analyzing earnings has been tracking the macro trends across sectors, industries, and companies. With the three widgets on the top showing trending industries, companies, and topics based on sentiment changes, users can find what's trending from a macro-level perspective and quickly know where to pay attention to.</p>

        <p class="mt-12 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Capturing the dynamic change among sectors and industries as new calls come in was not easy. In the early iterations, we used a heat map where different shades of green and red represent positive and negative sentiment changes. After a couple of customer meetings and testings, we found that users cared more about which sectors or industries had more changes than others.</p>
        <video autoplay loop muted class="mt-12 rounded shadow-xl" src="assets/topicdeltas/IndustryOverview.mp4" ></video>
        <p class="mt-12 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">With a heat map, it was difficult to tell which ones had bigger changes from the colors as the scale of change in aggregate sentiment scores was very small. I decided to change it to a line chart as it captures more details about how the sentiment evolves over time as the earnings season is happening. This allows users to see more granular details about how different companies affect the sector and the industry's sentiment trend.</p>

        <p class="mt-12 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">In early iterations, users needed to select a sector and industry before they could see any data. They would then see an aggregate sentiment and importance score history for the companies selected. We learned from the testings that this took users too much effort to compare performances across companies.</p>
        <p class="mt-3 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">This was changed to a flow where users start with selecting an industry and seeing all the relevant information within the industry after. I also put more focus on the sentiment delta so it's easier for users to find actionable insights like out or underperformers.</p>

        <p class="mt-12 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Previously, we provided filtering options for users to select topics under different thresholds. We later found that it wasn't used as much as expected. Users wanted to have a more holistic view before they decided to dive deeper. This resulted in a simpler user flow and layout that adapted to the users' workflow.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">In the Earnings Calls page, users can compare and contrast the key statements in the call classified by different topics as well as the historical performance for each topic. The semantic details of textured, nuanced language not only provide the transparency of how the machine works behind the scenes but also enable investors to find patterns that were previously invisible.</p>

        <p class="mt-12 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">In earlier versions, the Earnings Transcript page showed the topical snippets from the two most recent quarters side by side. Users needed to scroll to see all the topics. Some topics might have a lot more content than others, which would take a huge portion of the screen and make the browsing cumbersome. We also had feedback that the big boxes that were color-coded for sentiment scoring were sometimes distracting when reading the texts.</p>
        <p class="mt-3 mx-24 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">I redesigned it to a layout where users can navigate between topics with the topic section on the left and the topical snippets on the right. This gives users more space to read through the content for each topic while spending less time navigating.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Designing a product for a domain often requires a significant amount of background knowledge. This also means that some of the design principles that I learned from past experiences might not apply in certain case scenarios. In the beginning, I tended to stuck myself in the thought process and made decisions based on unvalidated assumptions.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">It did not take long for me to realize that research is the key to understanding user behaviors and problems and validating design assumptions and ideas at an early stage. I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with a group of knowledgable and supportive domain experts and users during the process. Through research, I was able to obtain insights into the user space and iterated my designs in the right direction.</p>
