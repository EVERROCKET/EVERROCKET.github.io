            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Accrete, a fintech startup, focused on using AI to help investors make better investing decisions. Topic Deltas, one of the product offerings, was a dashboard aiming to surface market-moving insights from company earnings calls. I led the design end-to-end, from conducting user interviews to iterating on prototypes to delivering handoffs. I collaborated with 1 Product Manager, 2 Data Scientists, and 3 Engineers from February 2019 to August 2019.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The internet has made huge volumes of company data readily available to investors. To generate macro-level as well as company-specific insights in a timely manner, however, has been increasingly challenging due to the information overload in the financial markets.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If an investor were to go through all the earnings transcripts in the past 8 quarters of all the companies in the S&P 500 Index, it could take weeks to decipher the insightful information across different sectors, industries, and companies. In this project, our goal was to create a tool that helps investors discover investment opportunities from earnings calls transcripts in an efficient and scalable way.</p>

                        Oftentimes, investing signals lie within the quarterly changes in some aspects of a company or changes across companies in a given quarter. These data are scattered and can take a long time for investors to aggregate and draw comparisons.

                        Remarks by a company in the earnings calls are carefully prepared, and therefore slightly different language on the same topic can have significant implications. To quantify these nuances, however, is no easy task.
