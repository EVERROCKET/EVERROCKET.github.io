            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">As an industry leader in customer engagement, Braze has been investing in building products with artificial intelligence (AI) to enable marketers to advance campaign strategies with data insights. I was responsible for designing Braze's first AI-powered product suite: Predictions. We subsequently launched Predictive Churn and Predictive Purchases to help marketers reduce user disengagement and drive conversions with automated data analytics, in August 2020 and August 2021, respectively.

            <h1 class="mt-1 text-3xl font-bold font-robo text-gray-800" >Marketers have an increasing need for strategizing campaigns with data analysis but are hindered by dependency on technical teams</h1>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As a marketer, the goal is to target the right audience with the right message at the right time. However, to do this effectively at scale is no easy task. It requires sophisticated machine learning systems to turn the data into actionable insights at a user level. The marketers often rely on a team of data scientists to build these systems. With resource constraints and sometimes lack of priority, it can take months to see any analysis results. With Predictions, we aimed to make it as easy as possible for marketers to create predictive models so they can focus on orchestrating effective marketing campaigns.  </p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I led the design for the product suite since April 2020. A beta version for Predictive Churn was being tested with a group of users when I joined. I was first tasked with working with the beta users and iterating on the designs for the public launch in August 2020. Following Predictive Churn, I led the design for Predictive Purchases from inception to launch, which was in August 2021. I collaborated with 1 Product Manager, 1 User Researcher, 2 Data Scientists, and 4 Engineers.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I started by looking at relevant products on the market and the previous user research done by our PM Boris and my manager Liza, who was the design lead for the project until I took it on. Below were the key findings: </p>
            <ul class="pl-5 mt-3 font-inter text-gray-800 leading-relaxed list-disc">
                <li>Businesses have different definitions for user churn, so marketers expect to be able to specify that in the product</li>
                <li>Marketers usually have different targeted strategies for users with different propensities. For example, they would send larger discounts to users more likely to churn to win them back</li>
                <li>Besides the predictive results, users would also like to see explanations on how the model works to feel comfortable using the product</li>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We interviewed 8 beta users and had them walk us through how they’ve used the initial version. Below is a summary of the pain points:</p>
            <ul class="pl-5 mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-800 leading-relaxed list-disc">
                <li>Users found it unintuitive to define churn the way they wanted with the traditional segmentation filters</li>
                <li>Users were overwhelmed by the amount of textual information and generally didn’t find them helpful</li>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A typical marketer has little knowledge about machine learning, so we need to make the process of creating a prediction model and analyzing the results as simple as possible, while maintaining a level of transparency that builds trust.

            <ul class="pl-5 mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-800 leading-relaxed list-disc">
                <li>Provide better guidance on how to create a predictive model</li>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We conducted usability testing with 9 customers over Zoom to test how users would interact with the model results.

            <p class="text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We found that when all the settings are on one page, it was difficult to understand what to do when errors due to insufficient data occurred.

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">With this iteration, I separated each configuration for creating a prediction into a one-page step, allowing users to focus on one task at a time without getting distracted by errors from other settings.
