As the Design Lead, I collaborated with one developer, one researcher, and one project manager to deliver Together, a mobile app that enhances peer-learning and tutoring experiences in calculus.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">At present, tutors at Virginia Tech have no data to inform their work with individual students. Students seeking tutoring identify the particular concept or procedure they find challenging. Through discussion and practice, the tutor discerns how best to assist the student. This is especially complicated in a group session where the students may bring a diversity of learning challenges to a tutor. Tutoring sessions also are constrained by time. In this project, the challenge is to create a learning resource to facilitate more effective tutoring in individual and group sessions, specifically in foundational calculus courses.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">With the help of Virginia Tech, we identified our target audience of students who had received tutoring for Math 1225, the tutors themselves, and coordinators for both tutoring services and calculus. We spoke with 25 participants over a period of three days. Our structured interviews covered general topics, which led to deeper discussions about tutoring experiences. Additionally, we launched a survey to gather feedback from the wider audience, which resulted in 308 responses.</p>

We used Axure to create multiple iterations of our medium fidelity prototype. These iterations provided the core results of user testing. We examined the quality of the user flow and looked for user’s confusions and misunderstandings. Additionally, their feedback provided many insights into new features that were implemented as well as existing features that needed more emphasis or reworking.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Different students have different preferences when attending study events. They may want to choose whom they interact with, the topics that will be discussed, the size of the group, or the event dynamics.</p>

                <p class="pt-12 px-6 text-base self-center font-inter text-gray-700">Students have a number of options when creating an event. They can make events public or private, set the maximum number of partipants, and choose topics to be discussed.</p>

            <h1 class="pt-20 text-2xl  font-robo text-gray-800" >An improved workflow of group tutoring sessions</h1>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Group tutoring sessions are sometimes overcrowded. In crowded sessions, students often have to wait for tutors to find time to work with them, and that time is usually limited. The system is in need of an optimized solution to group the students with similar needs. Groupings help improve efficiency by allowing students with similar problems to help each other as well as allowing tutors to work with multiple students at once.</p>

                <p class="pt-12 px-6 text-base self-center font-inter text-gray-700">The help queue in Together facilitates offline interactions in tutor-led group study sessions. When students join a session they can add themselves to a queue based on their topic of interest.</p>

            <h1 class="pt-20 text-2xl  font-robo text-gray-800" >More visible data helps stakeholders make better decisions</h1>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base font-inter text-gray-700">Together helps build a data-driven community by collecting key data points from students. These data points may include questions and comments to tutors and instructors. Tutors can receive feedback about their events through student ratings that focus on whether the students accomplished their goals. Administrators can receive information about event frequency, popular topics, and comments.</p>

                <p class="pt-12 px-6 text-base self-center font-inter text-gray-700">Students can leave comments and respond to other’s comments before tutoring events. This feature also benefits tutors by allowing them to understand students’ questions and problems ahead of time.</p>
