In the 24 epic hours of development, we built a wearable auxiliary product that helps the blind to avoid obstacles and navigate them to destinations. Our team got in the general top 10 and won the Audience Favorite Prize out of over 80 teams. We continued to improve the product in the following months. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Problem Space</h3> <p> <span>“</span> 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are blind and 246 have low vision.”—World Health Organization </p> <p> As it is been said above, there is a large number of people who are blind and need to be independent and safe enough while moving. To be safe when going outside, two purposes for blind persons have to be reached: </p> <ul> <li> <span class="black"> to effectively avoid the possibly dangerous obstacles; </span> </li> <li> <span class="black"> to navigate to the destination by themselves (e.g. home, school, company, etc.) </span> </li> </ul> <p> Thus, we wanted to help the visually impaired to move without encountering obstacles, and navigate them to specific destinations on their own. We observed many scenarios in which this group of people use old-school guiding tools for going out. Those tools cannot solve the both problems simultaneously. </p> <ul> <li> <span class="black"> The tools help blind persons sense limited distance from obstacles and the range of things. </span> Standard canes, for instance, are poor at detecting obstacles that are above waist height and do not have a touch-point on the ground, such as tree branches sticking out into the path. Besides, they could just sense the things within around one meter. The distance is sometimes too close for people to instantly avoid the obstacles. </li> <li> <span class="black"> The blind are not always led to the safe space. </span> Although those guiding tools may help people avoid obstacles, they do not know where is safe and where is not. For example, people might mistakenly think they are walking on the sidewalks when they go across the roads full of cars. Those tools cannot tell the difference. </li> <li> <span class="black"> The tools cannot navigate. </span> For blind people, to find out the destinations is challenging. Guide dogs might help sometimes, but just for the places the dogs are familiar with. Getting to the places they have never been to would be extremely difficult. </li> </ul> </div> <div class="sideColumn" style="top: 480px"> <div class="sideImgCon"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Tree.45876213.png" alt="Tree"> </div> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>They Need More Safety While Moving</h3> <p> <span class="black"> Get more information on what they face </span> <br> To address the problems above, the blind-guiding tools should be put into more intelligence. We have conducted a literature review on methods of object recognition and found that there are two major ways to detect objects: ultrasound technology and image recognition. Intensive researches have been working on improving recognition accuracy of image recognition algorithms. Plus, using ultrasound technology to effectively recognize objects could be costly since it needs several additional devices. Therefore, we chose image recognition as our main technique for obstacle detection. We utilized the principle of Binocular Stereo Vision, which could help our algorithms to reconstruct 3D pictures of the objects and result in the positions and distances. </p> </div> <div class="sideColumn rela" style="top: 100px"> <div class="showImageCon"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Algorithm.4513a48a.png"> </div> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <p> <span class="black"> Know the direction they should move to in next step </span> <br> We designed a hardware system, a headband built in two cameras and nine vibration modules towards different directions. Cameras collect and process real-time image flow through the algorithms. When approaching obstacles are detected, corresponding vibration module will vibrate to inform the user to avoid. For example, if there is a tree standing on the left, vibration module towards the left will vibrate so users could know they should avoid and move right in next step. Moreover, we developed a mobile app combined with SDK from Google Maps and Baidu Maps. Through Bluetooth headset, the blind can use voice commands to trigger voice navigation to the destination they set and then be guided within the route. </p> </div> <div class="sideColumn rela" style="top: 40px"> <div class="showImageCon"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/HeadringDesign.21da0deb.png"> <p class="black" style="text-align: center;padding-right: 34px">Conceptual Design for the Product</p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="row imgColumnOne"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/LeftSide.13330ab3.png" class="col-sm-offset-0 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6 col-sm-6"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/RightSide.4374cb8e.png" class="col-sm-offset-0 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6 col-sm-6"> </div> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <p> <span class="black"> Be connected with relatives and friends </span> <br> Our mobile app allows user\'s relatives or friends to connect with the user.

When user walks on the supposed route for a specific amount of time, a deviation alert will be sent to relatives and friends. User and relatives or friends can have a chat if necessary. If relatives use text message, text-to-speech module powered by iFLYTEK will translate the message into speech, which the blind user can hear. They are also able to use the app to request the cameras to send back the pictures of what the user faces at the time. </p> </div> </section> <div class="row showImageCon padX60Con"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Tracker.6743d6c3.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Warning.4bed3205.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Notification.52daee89.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"> </div> <div class="row showImageCon padX60Con"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Contact1.8cafd21c.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Contact2.e4ec4302.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/FreeToGo/Contact3.f750d8e9.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"> </div> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <p> As it is described above, the whole process involves close interaction among people, hardware and software.

Afterwards, I joined the team of four graduate students in CS from Stanford University, UC Berkeley, CMU and Columbia University and worked as a designer to help launch the product for real-world users. Hummer aims to help amateur singers perform better through playing the game in which players are required to sing to control a humming bird to go through adventurous terrains. We evaluate learner’s progress, and adaptively change the game to create a learning curriculum. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Problem Space</h3> <p> In order to better understand the challenges involved and pinpoint the user demands, we spent one week on using and anatomizing near 10 popular related products, including Sing! by Smule, Rhythm Master by Tencent, SoundHound, ScoreCloud, Changba, etc. We also interviewed with a group of users who are obsessed with these products. From the analysis on products and the feedbacks from users, we had the insights below: </p> <ul> <li> <span class="black"> Most of the users started using the products with the initial purpose of enhancing singing skill or musical training. </span> When asked about why they kept playing with such products, people\'s answers were basically varied, including playing or singing just for fun, getting to meet other users through the platforms, following those senior singers and so on. Yet, another idea is common among them: hoping to improve their singing skills. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <span class="black"> The products give little systematic feedbacks that are helpful to improve user\'s singing skill. </span> They are either highly community-based Karaoke such as Sing! or exclusively entertaining games like Rhythm Master. Although they may provide scores after finishing a song according to users’ performance, users cannot hone their skills of singing through such simple feedbacks. </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <span class="black"> People want experiences that are both entertaining and educational. </span> They need products that are entertaining and meanwhile are capable of providing them with professional and systematic feedbacks through which they could improve singing performance correspondingly. </li> </ul> </div> <div class="sideColumn" style="top: 210px"> <div class="sideImgCon"> <img src="../images/Hummer/Interview1.0afbd123.png" alt="interview"> <img src="../images/Hummer/Interview2.3a0db847.png" alt="interview"> </div> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Solution</h3> <p> In the light of insights above, we brainstormed several feasible ideas for our product. To ensure that our methods could be justified in professional way, we consulted students majoring in Vocal Music from Central Conservatory of Music. Eventually, we came up with the solution below: </p> <h4> Pitch Detection </h4> <ul> <li> We provide users with songs in different levels according to the complexity of pitches. Songs that have relatively narrow ranges of pitches are defined as easy levels, while those having broader ranges of pitches are harder. </li> <li> Users need to go through the game levels from easy to hard. In each level, they are required to sing with correct pitches to catch up the standard pitches. To pass each level, they need to reach more than a specific amount of standard pitches. </li> </ul> <h4>Sense of Rhythm</h4> <ul> <li> The moment users sing in each pitch should match the rhythm. Singing earlier or later than the standard pitch will lower the scores. </li> <li> The difficulty of each level also involves the complexity of rhythms. To pass each level, users need to match more than a specific amount of standard rhythms. </li> </ul> <h4>Learning While Playing</h4> <ul> <li> We designed a game pattern in which users sing through microphones to control a humming bird to go through the adventurous terrains. </li> <li> To successfully navigate through the terrains in the game and gain scores, users need to sing well enough to reach the correct pitches and match the rhythms. </li> </ul> <p> According to the standards above, after users play each song the app will show the scores as a whole to them. Besides, feedbacks that contain which parts users need to improve are also available, and they can choose to go back to practice those parts again and again until they sing good enough to reach the requirements. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>The Design</h3> <h4> Pitch Setup </h4> <p> Before getting started, user\'s pitch would be collected so that our algorithms adapt to user\'s voice. </p> </div> </section> <div class="row showImageCon padX35Con"> <img src="../images/Hummer/PitchSetup1.c6e45634.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/Hummer/PitchSetup2.30a7c84d.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-0 col-xs-offset-1"> <img src="../images/Hummer/PitchSetup3.7df9840e.png" class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"> </div> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h4>Songs in Progress</h4> <p> Users can access to three different songs in each level.

We attempted to build a gesture control armband that allows people to control computers and other devices in a simpler way. OneArm recognizes users\' gestures by measuring electrical activities (sEMG: Surface Electromyography) from muscles on their arms. We use Bluetooth to connect OneArm and compatible devices. With the software client, users are able to take control of applications on computer or other devices with five basic gestures and their specific combinations. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Insight into Products</h3> <p> Thanks to several major breakthroughs in Gesture Recognition, there came out a number of revolutionary technologies that bring people to more intuitive interaction with machines, such as Kinect, Leap Motion, etc. However, the defects are also apparent: users are limited in specific area of activities to operate the machines, as they detect people\'s gestures via Image Recognition; people are not able to stay out of the space where the cameras cannot capture. Besides, as people keep further distance from the cameras, the recognition accuracy will decrease. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Designing the Prototype</h3> <p> To break the constraints stated above, we designed an armband which measures electrical activity from people\'s muscles to identify five basic gestures from their hands. With the help of EMG sensors, we are able to collect the biological data from muscles when people make gestures. After extracting and processing the characteristic information through our algorithms, gestures can be detected. </p> <p> The OneArm armband mainly consists of operational amplifier, instrumentation amplifier, power management integrated circuit, and microcontroller. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="allImgColumn"> <img src="../images/oneArm/BandDetail.fa4a7742.png"> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <p> We 3D printed the cases that contain electrical components and connect them together using springs to be flexible enough to fit in different sizes of arms. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="allImgColumn"> <img src="../images/oneArm/OnHand.5fe3f290.png" style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px"> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Application Client</h3> <p> To let users update the real-time status about their OneArms, make personal settings and connect with compatible applications and devices, we designed the application client. With the client, people are able to switch the device or application controlled to another. We defined five basic gestures for users to operate: fist, double tap, spread fingers, wave right and wave left, which are native and intuitive actions that people easily make to control the things. </p> <h4> User Guide </h4> <p> People will access to the necessary instruction on how to use OneArm. When user tries to make five different basic gestures in User Guide, software\'s standard model will be calibrated to user\'s personal data so that our algorithms could detect the gestures quicker.

Lin Zhao, the founder of OneArm, took the original idea of OneArm to participate in Imagine Cup held by Microsoft in April, 2013. OneArm got in the finals and was awarded as the second place in China Division. Meanwhile, the demo video of Myo first came out and greatly aroused people\'s interest. After Lin Zhao graduated in June, 2014, he decided to start up his own company and turn OneArm into real commercial product. </p> <p> The principles of two products are basically the same; both utilized sEMG to detect people\'s gestures. Myo has already gained a number of customers and the API is also open to developers, which encourages more applications developed for Myo. OneArm currently is in the phase of demo and looking for Venture Capital. </p> <p> Our vision is to build OneArm for special demands from China\'s users, cutting in China\'s market. Thus, we have less complex functions than that of Myo. Myo\'s market price is 1,600 RMB–2,000 RMB. We are confident that the cost of OneArm could be reduced to around 200 RMB when it goes into production. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row showImageCon padX20Con" style="text-align: center"> <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"> <img src="../images/oneArm/ConceptualDesignA.d9f89360.png" style="max-height: 300px"> </div> <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-md-offset-0 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"> <img src="../images/oneArm/ConceptualDesignB.9ec8e26e.png" style="max-height: 300px"> </div> <p class="black">Conceptual Design of OneArm</p> </section> <div class="videoCon"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2hnLcfpnHo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p class="black">Demo video of OneArm</p> </div> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3> Personal Thoughts </h3> <p> In March, 2015, I was invited by Lin Zhao to join the team as the part-time Design Lead at OneArm. This was my first start-up experience. It was totally different from any projects I have done before; I needed to consider the demands for real-world users, be involved with other team members to fix the problems, learn to clearly illustrate our idea and business objectives to investors and many other things that I learned a lot from. </p> <p> In May, 2015, after I joined the team for nearly three months, we launched our first demo product. We presented OneArm in several entrepreneurial forums and met a lot of investors. Although OneArm did not receive enough funds to continue, I really appreciated the time I spent with the team on working hard to build the product. I have gained lots of valuable experiences about startups and entrepreneurship, which better prepared me for future career with a wider vision. </p> </div> </section> </div> <div class="preNextLink"> <a class="viewMore prev" href="/#hummer"> <span class="pointL"></span> PREVIOUS </a> <a class="viewMore backToTop" href="javascript:$(&quot;html&quot;).animate({&quot;scrollTop&quot;: &quot;0px&quot;},400);$(&quot;body&quot;).animate({&quot;scrollTop&quot;: &quot;0px&quot;},400)"> BACK TO TOP </a> <a class="viewMore next" href="/#freeToGo"> NEXT <span class="pointR"></span> </a> </div> </div> </div> <footer style="color: #333;text-align: center;margin: 15px">© 2015 Junyu Huang.

After two months of development, our team won the First Prize out of more than 60 teams. </p> </div> </section> <section class="row"> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>The Problem</h3> <p> Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST) is among the largest universities in China. When I first came to my university, I found that the campus was so large that it took me a long time to get familiar with the campus. In fact, after I spent one year on living in Apartment 16, Yunyuan, I even could not easily find the Apartment 15, Yunyuan. </p> <p> To justify the problem stated above, I asked a group of students who lived on campus for less than one year about how they get to the buildings they have never been to. Many of them claimed that they were usually confused about the structure of the buildings on campus and it often took a significant amount of time for them to find out the buildings. However, the apps like Google Maps, Baidu Maps did not provide much detailed information about buildings on campus. </p> <div class="imgColumnOne"> <img src="../images/OverHUST/HUSTMap.92cd5653.png"> </div> </div> <div class="mainColumn"> <h3>Designing the Problem-solving Features</h3> <p> We took advantage of street view map SDK from Tencent Maps and developed an app featured with four major functions based on campus.
